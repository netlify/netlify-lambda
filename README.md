## Netlify Lambda

This is an optional tool that helps with building or locally developing [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) with a simple webpack/babel build step. For function folders, there is also a small utility to install function folder dependencies.

The goal is to make it easy to write Lambda's with transpiled JS/TypeScript features and imported modules.

<details>
  <summary><b>Multiple ways to deploy functions on Netlify</b></summary>

There are 3 ways to deploy functions to Netlify:

1. each function as a single JS or Go file, possibly bundled by a build tool like `netlify-lambda` or `tsc`
2. each function as a zip of a folder of files
3. as of [CLI v2.7](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/#unbundled-javascript-function-deploys?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex), a non-bundled, non-zipped, folder of files.

`Netlify-Lambda` uses webpack to bundle up your functions and their dependencies for you, suiting the first approach. However, if you have native node modules (or other dependencies that don't expect to be bundled like [the Firebase SDK](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/112)) then you may want to try the other approaches. In particular, try [`Netlify Dev`](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-jamstack&utm_campaign=devex#netlify-dev-beta).

If this sounds confusing, support is available through [our regular channels](https://www.netlify.com/support/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex).

### When to use Netlify Dev or `netlify-lambda` or both?

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-jamstack&utm_campaign=devex#netlify-dev-beta">Netlify Dev</a> is incrementally adoptable. <b>Use `netlify-lambda` only if you need a build step for your functions.</b> Expand this to read more on when to use either or both</summary>


- **When to use Netlify Dev**: Part of Netlify Dev serves unbundled function folders through [zip-it-and-ship-it](https://github.com/netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it) with no build step. This is likely to be attractive to many users who previously just needed `netlify-lambda` for bundling multi-file functions or functions with node_module dependencies.
- **When to use Netlify Lambda**: However, if you need a build step for your functions (e.g. for webpack import/export syntax, running babel transforms or typescript), you can use `netlify-lambda`, `tsc` or your own build tool to do this, just point Netlify Dev at your build output with the `functions` field in `netlify.toml`.
- These responsibilities aren't exactly the same. Therefore **you can use Netlify Dev and Netlify Lambda together** to have BOTH a build step for functions from `netlify-lambda` and the full proxy environment from Netlify Dev. If you have a npm script in `package.json` for running `netlify-lambda serve ${functionsSourceFolder}`, Netlify Dev will [detect it](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin#function-builders-function-builder-detection-and-relationship-with-netlify-lambda) and run it for you. This way, **existing `netlify-lambda` users will be able to use Netlify Dev with no change to their workflow**

Function Builder detection is a very new feature with only simple detection logic for now, that we aim to improve over time. If it doesn't work well for you, you can simply not use Netlify Dev for now while we work out all your bug reports. üôèüèº

**You can see how to convert a Netlify-Lambda project to Netlify Dev as well as why and how they work together in [this 48 min video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakKOT6nkkE)**

</details>

## Installation

**We recommend installing locally** rather than globally:

```bash
npm install netlify-lambda
```

This will ensure your build scripts don't assume a global install which is better for your CI/CD (for example with Netlify's buildbot).

If you don't have a [`netlify.toml`](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) file, you'll need one ([example](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/blob/master/netlify.toml)). Define the `functions` field where the functions will be built to and served from, e.g.

```toml
# example netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  functions = "lambda" #  netlify-lambda reads this
  publish = "build"
```

## Usage

We expose three commands:

```bash
netlify-lambda build <folder>
netlify-lambda install [folder]

## legacy command - only preserved for backward compatibility
netlify-lambda serve <folder> 
```

### `netlify-lambda install`

Sometimes your function folders will have dependencies unique to them, managed by a package.json local to that folder. This is a small utility function for installing those dependencies either on your local machine or as part of your build commands.

By default it just runs on the functions folder specified in `netlify.toml`. Here's all you need to add to your `package.json` (see [this example](https://github.com/sw-yx/gatsby-netlify-form-example-v2/commit/f88462a4c37b5ddcdf5f394606ac14b58d6b475d#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2)):

```js
// package.json
{
   "scripts": {
       "postinstall": "netlify-lambda install"
   }
}
```

This is what you should do if you are just using Netlify Dev without `netlify-lambda`.

If you're using `netlify-lambda serve` or `build`, however, you will want to run this install on the _source_ folder rather than the _dist_/netlify.toml functions folder, so you should run it with the same exact folder name as with those other commands:

```bash
netlify-lambda install <folderName>
```

We don't anticipate you will use this as often but it can be handy.

### `netlify-lambda build`

At a high level, `netlify-lambda` takes a source folder (e.g. `src/lambda`, specified in your command) and outputs it to a built folder, (e.g. `built-lambda`, specified in your `netlify.toml` file).

The `build` function will run a single build of the functions in the folder.

The `serve` function will start a dev server for the source folder and route requests with a `.netlify/functions/` prefix, with a default port of `9000`:

```
folder/hello.js -> http://localhost:9000/.netlify/functions/hello
```

It also watches your files and restarts the dev server on change. Note: if you add a new file you should kill and restart the process to pick up the new file.

**IMPORTANT**:

- You need a [`netlify.toml`](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) file with a `functions` field.
- Every function needs to be a top-level js/ts/mjs file. You can have subfolders inside the `netlify-lambda` folder, but those are only for supporting files to be imported by your top level function. Files that end with `.spec.*` or `.test.*` will be ignored so you can [colocate your tests](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/99).
- Function signatures follow the [AWS event handler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html) syntax but must be named `handler`. [We use Node v8](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/04/03/node.js-8.10-now-available-in-netlify-functions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) so `async` functions **are** supported ([beware common mistakes](https://serverless.com/blog/common-node8-mistakes-in-lambda/)!). Read [Netlify Functions docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#javascript-lambda-functions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) for more info.
- Functions [time out in 10 seconds](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#custom-deployment-options) by default although extensions can be requested. We [try to replicate this locally](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/116).

<details>
  <summary><b>Environment variables in build and branch context</b></summary>

Read Netlify's [documentation on environment variables](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex).
`netlify-lambda` should respect the env variables you supply in `netlify.toml` accordingly (except for deploy previews, which make no sense to locally emulate).

However, this is a [relatively new feature](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/59), so if you encounter issues, file one.

If you need local-only environment variables that you don't place in `netlify.toml` for security reasons, you can configure webpack to use a `.env` file [like in this example](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/118).

</details>

  <summary>
    <b>Lambda function examples</b>
  </summary>
  If you are new to writing Lambda functions, this section may help you. Function signatures should conform to one of either two styles. Traditional callback style:
  
  ```js
// legacy callback style - not encouraged anymore, but you'll still see examples doing this
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  // your server-side functionality
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `Hello world ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}`
    })
  });
};
  ```
  
  or you can use async/await:
  
  ```js
// modern JS style - encouraged
export async function handler(event, context) {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: `Hello world ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}` })
    };
}
  ```
> :warning: The above example only works with `netlify-lambda` because [it uses ES module syntax](https://community.netlify.com/t/async-await-lambda-function-example/6976/3)! If you get `Function invocation failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'.` errors, this is why.

### `netlify-lambda serve` (legacy command)

This command is pretty much superceded by Netlify Dev. We only keep it around for legacy/backward compatibility support reasons.

#### `netlify-lambda serve` (legacy command): Using with `create-react-app`, Gatsby, and other development servers

<details>
<summary><b>Why you need to proxy (for beginners)</b></summary>

`react-scripts` (the underlying library for `create-react-app`) and other popular development servers often set up catchall serving for you; in other words, if you try to request a route that doesn't exist, the dev server will try to serve you `/index.html`. This is problematic when you are trying to hit a local API endpoint like `netlify-lambda` sets up for you - your browser will attempt to parse the `index.html` file as JSON. This is why you may see this error:

`Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0`

If this desribes your situation, then you need to proxy for local development. Read on. Don't worry it's easier than it looks.

</details>

#### `netlify-lambda serve` (legacy command): Proxying for local development

> ‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CORS ISSUES‚ö†Ô∏è

When your function is deployed on Netlify, it will be available at `/.netlify/functions/function-name` for any given deploy context. It is advantageous to proxy the `netlify-lambda serve` development server to the same path on your primary development server.

Say you are running `webpack-serve` on port 8080 and `netlify-lambda serve` on port 9000. Mounting `localhost:9000` to `/.netlify/functions/` on your `webpack-serve` server (`localhost:8080/.netlify/functions/`) will closely replicate what the final production environment will look like during development, and will allow you to assume the same function url path in development and in production.

- If you are using with `create-react-app`, see [netlify/create-react-app-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/blob/f0e94f1d5a42992a2b894bfeae5b8c039a177dd9/src/setupProxy.js) for an example of how to do this with `create-react-app`. [setupProxy is partially documented in the CRA docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually). You can also learn how to do this from scratch in a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldSM98nCHI
- If you are using Gatsby, see [their Advanced Proxying docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/api-proxy/#advanced-proxying). This is implemented in the [JAMstack Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sw-yx/jamstack-hackathon-starter).
- If you are using React-Static, check https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/issues/380.
- If you are using Nuxt.js, see [this issue for how to proxy](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/28#issuecomment-439675503).
- If you are using Vue CLI, you may just use https://github.com/netlify/vue-cli-plugin-netlify-lambda/.
- If you are using with Angular CLI, see the instructions below.

[Example webpack config](https://github.com/imorente/netlify-functions-example/blob/master/webpack.development.config):

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      "/.netlify": {
        target: "http://localhost:9000",
        pathRewrite: { "^/.netlify/functions": "" }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Using with <code>Angular CLI</code></b>
  </summary>

CORS issues when trying to use netlify-lambdas locally with angular? you need to set up a proxy.

Firstly make sure you are using relative paths in your app to ensure that your app will work locally and on Netlify, example below...

```js
this.http.get("/.netlify/functions/jokeTypescript");
```

Then place a `proxy.config.json` file in the root of your project, the contents should look something like...

```json
{
  "/.netlify/functions/*": {
    "target": "http://localhost:9000",
    "secure": false,
    "logLevel": "debug",
    "changeOrigin": true
  }
}
```

- The `key` should match up with the location of your Transpiled `functions` as defined in your `netlify.toml`
- The `target` should match the port that the lambdas are being served on (:9000 by default)

When you run up your Angular project you need to pass in the proxy config with the flag `--proxy-config` like so...

```bash
  ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json
```

To make your life easier you can add these to your `scripts` in `package.json`

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json",
    "build": "ng build --prod --aot && yarn nlb",
    "nls": "netlify-lambda serve src_functions",
    "nlb": "netlify-lambda build src_functions"
  }
```

Obviously you need to run up `netlify-lambda` & `angular` at the same time.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Using with <code>Next.js</code></b>
  </summary>

Next.js [doesnt use Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/2281), so you can't modify any config in `next.config.js` to get a proxy to run. However, since the CORS proxy issue only happens in dev mode (Functions are on the same domain when deployed on Netlify) you can run Next.js through a Node server for local development:

```js
touch server.js
yarn add -D http-proxy-middleware express
```

```js
// server.js
/* eslint-disable no-console */
const express = require("express");
const next = require("next");

const devProxy = {
  "/.netlify": {
    target: "http://localhost:9000",
    pathRewrite: { "^/.netlify/functions": "" }
  }
};

const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) || 3000;
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const dev = env !== "production";
const app = next({
  dir: ".", // base directory where everything is, could move to src later
  dev
});

const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

let server;
app
  .prepare()
  .then(() => {
    server = express();

    // Set up the proxy.
    if (dev && devProxy) {
      const proxyMiddleware = require("http-proxy-middleware");
      Object.keys(devProxy).forEach(function(context) {
        server.use(proxyMiddleware(context, devProxy[context]));
      });
    }

    // Default catch-all handler to allow Next.js to handle all other routes
    server.all("*", (req, res) => handle(req, res));

    server.listen(port, err => {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
      console.log(`> Ready on port ${port} [${env}]`);
    });
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log("An error occurred, unable to start the server");
    console.log(err);
  });
```

run your server and netlify-lambda at the same time:

```js
// package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=dev npm-run-all --parallel start:app start:server",
    "start:app": "PORT=3000 node server.js",
    "start:server": "netlify-lambda serve functions"
  },
```

and now you can ping Netlify Functions with locally emulated by `netlify-lambda`!

For production deployment, you have two options:

- [using `next export` to do static HTML export](https://nextjs.org/docs/#static-html-export)
- [using the Next.js 8 `serverless` target option](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/#serverless-nextjs) to run your site in a function as well.

Just remember to configure your `netlify.toml` to point to the `Next.js` build folder and your `netlify-lambda` functions folder accordingly.

</details>

## Webpack Configuration

By default the webpack configuration uses `babel-loader` to load all js files. 
`netlify-lambda` will search for [a valid babel config file](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) in the functions directory first and look upwards up to the directory `netlify-lambda` is run from (similar to how `babel-loader` looks for a Babel config file). 
If no babel config file is found, a [few basic settings are used](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/blob/be5305a0cf8a56b028e62345422c91c022855178/lib/build.js#L138-L176).

If you need to use additional webpack modules or loaders, you can specify an additional webpack config with the `-c`/`--config` option when running either `serve` or `build`.

For example, have a file with:

```js
// webpack.functions.js
module.exports = {
  optimization: { minimize: false }
};
```

Then specify `netlify-lambda serve --config ./webpack.functions.js`. If using VSCode, it is likely that the `sourceMapPathOverrides` have to be adapted for breakpoints to work. Read here for more info on [how to modify the webpack config](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/64#issuecomment-429625191).

If you're using firebase SDK and other native modules, check [this issue](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/112#issuecomment-489072330) and use this plugin:

```
//./config/webpack.functions.js
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');

module.exports = {
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
};
```

The additional webpack config will be merged into the default config via [webpack-merge's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) `merge.smart` method.

### Babel configuration

The default webpack configuration uses `babel-loader` with a [few basic settings](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/blob/be5305a0cf8a56b028e62345422c91c022855178/lib/build.js#L93-L104).

However, if any valid Babel config file is found in the directory `netlify-lambda` is run from, or [folders above it](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/92) (useful for monorepos), it will be used instead of the default one.

It is possible to disable this behaviour by passing `--babelrc false`.

If you need to run different babel versions for your lambda and for your app, [check this issue](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/34) to override your webpack babel-loader.

### Use with TypeScript

We added `.ts` and `.mjs` support recently - [check here for the PR and usage tips](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/76).

1. Install `@babel/preset-typescript`

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
```

You may also want to add `typescript @types/node @types/aws-lambda`.

2. Create a Babel config file, e.g. `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-typescript",
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "node": true
        }
      }
    ]
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-object-assign",
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"
  ]
}
```

3. (Optional) if you have `@types/aws-lambda` installed, your lambda functions can use the community typings for `Handler, Context, Callback`. See the typescript instructions in [create-react-app-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/blob/master/README.md#typescript) for an example.

Check https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-lambda-typescript for a CRA + Lambda full Typescript experience.

## CLI flags/options

There are additional CLI options:

```bash
-h --help
-c --config
-p --port
-s --static
-t --timeout
-b --babelrc
```

### --config option

If you need to use additional webpack modules or loaders, you can specify an additional webpack config with the `-c`/`--config` option when running either `serve` or `build`.

For example, have a file with:

```js
// webpack.functions.js
module.exports = {
  optimization: { minimize: false }
};
```

Then specify `netlify-lambda serve --config ./webpack.functions.js`.

### --timeout option

(This is for local dev/serving only) The default function timeout is 10 seconds. If you need to adjust this because you have requested extra timeout, pass a timeout number here. Thanks to [@naipath](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/116) for this feature.

### --port option

The serving port can be changed with the `-p`/`--port` option.

### --static option

If you need an escape hatch and are building your lambda in some way that is incompatible with our build process, you can skip the build with the `-s` or `--static` flag. [More info here](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/62).

### --babelrc

Defaults to `true`

Use a Babel config file found in the directory `netlify-lambda` is run from. This can be useful when you have conflicting babel-presets, more info [here](#babel-configuration)

## Netlify Identity

Make sure to [read the docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#identity-and-functions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) on how Netlify Functions and Netlify Identity work together. Basically you have to make your request with an `authorization` header and a `Bearer` token with your Netlify Identity JWT supplied. You can get this JWT from any of our Identity solutions from [gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) to [netlify-identity-widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget).

Since for practical purposes we cannot fully emulate Netlify Identity locally, we provide [simple JWT decoding inside the `context` of your function](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/pull/57). This will give you back the `user` info you need to work with.

Minor note: For the `identity` field, since we are not fully emulating Netlify Identity, we can't give you details on the Identity instance, so we give you [unambiguous strings](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/blob/be5305a0cf8a56b028e62345422c91c022855178/lib/serve.js#L88-L94) so you know not to rely on it locally: `NETLIFY_LAMBDA_LOCALLY_EMULATED_IDENTITY_URL` and `NETLIFY_LAMBDA_LOCALLY_EMULATED_IDENTITY_TOKEN`. In production, of course, Netlify Functions will give you the correct `identity.url` and `identity.token` fields. We find we dont use this info often in our functions so it is not that big of a deal in our judgment.

## Debugging

To debug lambdas, it can be helpful to turn off minification and enable logging. Prepend the `serve` command with [npm's package runner npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), e.g. `npx --node-arg=--inspect netlify-lambda serve ...`.

1. make sure that sourcemaps are built along the way (e.g. in the webpack configuration and the `tsconfig.json` if typescript is used)
2. webpack's minification/uglification is turned off (see below):

For example, to customize the webpack config you can have a file with:

```js
// webpack.functions.js
module.exports = {
  optimization: { minimize: false }
};
```

You can see [a sample project with this setup here](https://github.com/sw-yx/throwaway-test-netlify-lambda).

So you can run something like `npx --node-arg=--inspect netlify-lambda serve --config ./webpack.functions.js`. If using VSCode, it is likely that the `sourceMapPathOverrides` have to be adapted for breakpoints to work. Read here for more info on [how to modify the webpack config](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/issues/64#issuecomment-429625191).

Netlify Functions [run in Node v8.10](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/04/03/node.js-8.10-now-available-in-netlify-functions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-netlify-lambda&utm_campaign=devex) and you may need to run the same version to mirror the environment locally. Also make sure to check that you aren't [committing one of these common Node 8 mistakes in Lambda!](https://serverless.com/blog/common-node8-mistakes-in-lambda/)

**Special warning on `node-fetch`**: `node-fetch` and webpack [currently don't work well together](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/450). You will have to use the default export in your code:

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch").default; // not require('node-fetch')
```

Don't forget to search our issues in case someone has run into a similar problem you have!
